- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently CS student who work like yay day and night
- ðŸŒ± Learning:
  - Machine Learning on EEG signal for imagined speech detection
  - beginner on game programming in Unity (fun ha?)
  - beginner on app writing in javaScript
- ðŸ¤” What I think about my degree: 5% theory, 5% coding (yay), 90% ask google (and chat gpt) by yourself (kidding ðŸ˜ƒ)

Current Project âœ¨
- speech decoding from brain wave (EEG / MEG)
  
Past Projects ðŸš€
- Flutter! - 2D platformer game to fultter gravity!
- very naive stock analysing program
- very simple neural network model for machine learning on Traditional Chinese Medicine
- game coding by verilog on FPGA (why did I do that???)
